Understanding code base:
Renderer:
volume_renderer - this is plain nerf renderer
if_clight_renderer - training of neural bodies uses this. Looks like used for neural_volumes

if_clight_renderer_msk - for single camera pose for novel view

if_clight_renderer_mmsk - multi-view rendering

mesh_renderer - Rendering mesh using marching cubes


trainer.py - Core training loop. It embeds the network wrapper based on the input configuration file
	- nerf.py - volume renderer is used
	- if_nerf_clight.py - if_clight_renderer is used

Networks:
	- nerf.py - Used for volume rendering instead of voxel rendering
	- latent_xyzc.py - Voxel based predictor
	- nerf_mesh - not used in this code base
	- embedder - The embedding module mapping xyz to freq components 

All tpose looks not useful as of now. Not used.
