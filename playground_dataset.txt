Principal point offset: x0 = W/2, y0 = H/2
Focal length: fx = fy = 0.7 * W

fx = fy = 2688
x0 = 1920
y0 = 1080

colmap feature extractor time: Elapsed time: 23.497 [minutes]
mapper: Elapsed time: 134.456 [minutes]



Things to understand:
- how to optimize colmap mapper using less features?
- image has been resized by 8 dimension
- what is normalization of camera parameters mean?
